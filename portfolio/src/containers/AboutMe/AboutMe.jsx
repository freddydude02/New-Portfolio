            <p>
                Always curious and analytical, I dabbled in and out of the
                edu-tech industry for the most part of my life before
                discovering Nology. During which I dedicated my time into
                researching and discovering the depths of education and the
                science being learning. Fast forward to now I intend to mix my
                knowledge of learning and software technology together to create
                an impactful future where people learn and teach effectively and
                efficiently.
